The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an issue where the `:hover` pseudo-class unexpectedly affects elements outside its intended scope due to a lack of specificity:

```css
.container {
  width: 200px;
  height: 200px;
  background-color: lightgray;
}

.container:hover .inner {
  background-color: lightblue;
}

.inner {
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
  background-color: lightcoral;
  margin: 50px;
}
```

If you hover over the `.container`, the `.inner` element's background color changes as expected.  However, this same behavior can unexpectedly affect other `.inner` elements on the page if they exist outside of the `.container`, particularly if no other CSS rules affect them with higher specificity.  This is a common problem arising from the cascading nature of CSS and the potential ambiguity in selector specificity.
